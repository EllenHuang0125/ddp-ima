<h2>Great Court</h2>
<p>Enclosed under a spectacular glass and steel roof, the court contains a number of sculptures from the Museum's collection. The sculptures on display introduce the cultures represented in the galleries beyond and include examples from fifth-century Ireland, late Ming Dynasty China, ancient Nimrud (now in Iraq) and the Greek and Roman empires.<p></p>

The Great Court surrounds the famous Reading Room, a space that has been hailed as one of the great sights of London. It was once a world-famous centre of learning with famous readers, including Bram Stoker, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and even Lenin.</p>
